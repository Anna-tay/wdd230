                go through the website, the colors and fonts are very simple. The content is also easy to understand
                and is presented in a short form, with bullets and simple headings.

                Hick's law is all about smooth users experience, for Amazon, they have put all what they think the user will use the most at the 
                top of their screen with good headers for all of the different places for amazon. As you scroll they populate the screen with the item they
                think you will want or the items most popular. To them let the user see the items they might want first. Also for the items they sale, they have a picture,
                price and the title of the item, so you can see it clearly.

                When you first open up the website, you see what they want you to see first. What they think you want to see first, with a little animation to draw your
                attention. This is a great way to pull users attention to the stuff they are selling. As you scroll down the website this same pattern appears. They put pictures of the 
                products they are selling in a big font. They are making the products and names big, and the details of those products(price) small.
